# quarto-vscode

VS Code extension for the Quarto scientific and technical publshing system (https://quarto.org).

This extension provides syntax highlighting and snippets for Quarto .qmd files, 
including support for highlighting of executable code cells (which the default
markdown editing mode in VS Code does not highlight).

This extension is based on the built-in VS Code [markdown extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/markdown-basics),
with additional Quarto-specific capabilities.
